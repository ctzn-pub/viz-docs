# The Architecture of Evidence

Welcome to the **@ontopic/viz** documentation. This library is both a philosophical and technical guide to building credible visual evidence on the web—where R/Python’s statistical rigor meets modern interactive publishing.

## 🧬 This is a Living Specification

Unlike a static textbook, this project serves as the **Documentation of the Data Contract** for human and AI collaborators. It defines the formal bridge between analytical models and the visual interface.

## 🛠 The Technology Stack

- **Observable Plot**: technical, exploratory, and statistical graphics (the “ggplot2 of the web”).
- **Recharts**: polished, operational dashboards and executive summaries.
- **Tigris & Next.js**: the pipeline for delivering asynchronous model outputs from Python/R agents to the browser.

## 🤖 The Agentic Workflow

1. **Estimate**: An agent (or human) runs a model in Python or R.
2. **Contract**: The analysis is serialized into a JSON payload conforming to the specs defined in this handbook.
3. **Dispatch**: The payload is pushed to a **Tigris S3** bucket.
4. **Render**: The Next.js frontend detects the new data and hydrates the corresponding component instantly.
