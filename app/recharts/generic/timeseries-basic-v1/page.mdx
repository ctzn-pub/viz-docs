## Overview

The `TimeSeriesBasic` component provides a clean, focused way to visualize temporal data. It's designed for executive summaries where a single trend line is the primary focus.

## Data Contract

This component expects a `TimeTrendPayload`. The data should be an array of objects with `year` and `value` properties.

```typescript
interface DataPoint {
  year: string;
  value: number;
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Avoid Spaghetti**: Use this component when you have one primary series. For multiple series, use the `MultiLine` component.
- **Index for Comparison**: If comparing across different units, consider using the `IndexChart` instead.
- **Annotate Shocks**: Use the built-in annotation layer to mark significant policy shifts or economic shocks.
