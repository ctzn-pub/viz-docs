## Overview

The `IndexChart` is the primary tool for "base-year normalization." It allows for a direct comparison of growth rates between series, even if their raw levels are separated by orders of magnitude.

## Data Contract

The component expects two series in the FRED-style observations format.

```typescript
interface Series {
  title: string;
  observations: { date: string; value: string }[];
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Choose a Meaningful Base**: The first data point is set to 100 by default. Ensure this is a logical comparison point.
- **Be Careful with Ratios**: If one series starts at zero or is highly volatile, indexing can be misleading.
