## Overview

Uses "Small Multiples" (faceting) to compare relationships across different categories simultaneously.

## Best Practices

- **Shared Scales**: Always ensure facets share the same X and Y axes for honest comparison.
- **Narrative Flow**: Order facets logically (e.g., by volume or effect size).
