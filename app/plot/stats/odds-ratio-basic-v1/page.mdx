## Overview

Visualizes the relationship between an exposure and an outcome using Odds Ratios and their corresponding confidence intervals.

## Interpretation

- **Log Scale**: Typically rendered on a log scale to ensure symmetry around the null value (1.0).
- **Statistical Significance**: If the interval crosses 1.0, the effect is generally considered not statistically significant at the chosen alpha level.
