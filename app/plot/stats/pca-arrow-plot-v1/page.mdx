## Overview

The PCA Circle Arrow Plot (also known as a variable correlation circle) visualizes the relationships between variables and the first two principal components.

## Features

- **Directional Vectors**: Each arrow represents a variable's contribution and direction in the PC1-PC2 space.
- **Unit Circle**: Provides a reference for the maximum possible correlation (when a variable is perfectly represented by the shown components).
- **Sequential Coloring**: Arrows are color-coded by their contribution percentage, highlighting the most influential variables.
- **Dual Axes**: Dimensions are labeled with their respective variance explanation percentages.

## Data Structure

The component expects a JSON payload containing configuration and variable coordinates:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "title": "PCA Variables",
    "x_label": "PC1 (24.4%)",
    "y_label": "PC2 (23.3%)",
    "color_gradient": { "low": "#00AFBB", "mid": "#E7B800", "high": "#FC4E07" }
  },
  "variables": [
    { "name": "var1", "x": 0.5, "y": 0.3, "contrib": 12.5, "cos2": 0.75 }
  ]
}
```
